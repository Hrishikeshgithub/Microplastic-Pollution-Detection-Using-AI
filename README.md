# Microplastic-Pollution-Detection-Using-AI

This repository contains a machine learning solution to predict water potability using water quality parameters (pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity). Built with Python and Logistic Regression, it processes a dataset of water samples, trains a model to classify water as potable (1) or non-potable (0), and includes evaluation metrics and visualizations. Ideal for water safety analysis and resource management.
